# Codex Sinaiticus XML transcription

This repository contains the XML transcription of Codex Sinaiticus produced by the Codex Sinaiticus project in 2007â€“9. The digital edition of this manuscript is available at www.codexsinaiticus.org, published in 2009.

The XML consists of a mixture of standard TEI markup along with some elements added for the project. Full information about the elements and attributes is available in the following document in this repository: https://github.com/itsee-birmingham/codex-sinaiticus/blob/main/XMLspecs_sinaiticus.pdf

The transcription has been updated on several occasions since the initial publication. This repository contains the most recent version, with changes itemised in the initial changelog.  

There is also the option to download the XML from the digital edition itself at https://codexsinaiticus.org/en/project/transcription_download.aspx, but this may not be fully up to date.

This transcription also underlies the Logos module at https://www.logos.com/product/35581/codex-sinaiticus (released in 2012).
