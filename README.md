# Codex Sinaiticus XML transcription

This repository contains the XML transcription of Codex Sinaiticus produced by the Codex Sinaiticus project in 2007â€“9, with subsequent updates and upgrades. 

The digital edition of this manuscript is available at www.codexsinaiticus.org, first published in 2009. The current version at that site is v1.05 (March 2014; in the 'archive' folder here). The XML consists of a mixture of standard TEI markup along with some elements added for the project. Full information about the elements and attributes is available in the *XMLspecs_sinaiticus.pdf* document in the 'archive' folder. 
The initial project transcription (v1.00) also underlies the Logos module at https://www.logos.com/product/35581/codex-sinaiticus (released in 2012).

The transcription has been updated on several occasions since the initial publication. This repository contains the most recent version, with changes itemised in the initial changelog. The current version of the transcription is v1.94 (*sinaiticus_full_v194.xml*), which includes additional attributes on the word elements. This has been prepared for a new website: further adjustments are expected to lead to the v2.00 release in the new website. It may be validated against the *tei_all_sinaiticus.dtd* file also provided here.

Any questions may be addressed to the team at ITSEE, University of Birmingham.
